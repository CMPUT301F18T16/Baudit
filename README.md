## Overview 
Baudit is a health tracking Android application designed to help ease
the monitoring of an individual's (Patient) Medical Problems. 

Baudit helps Patients record their Medical Problems and provides options
to append Records onto their Medical Problems for enhancing the details
of their medical issues.

Additionally, Baudit also allows Care Providers to monitor Patients 
Medical Problems and Records. And if needed provide assistance in 
contacting Patients if their Medical Problems appear serious.
