## Branch Creation Standards

Branches **with the intention to be pulled into master** should follow a naming convention of `<intention name>/<intention description>`

**i.e**: a branch adding a feature of a new button could be named `feature/NewButton`

**i.e**: a branch fixing a bug regarding syntax error could be named `bugfix/SyntaxError`

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
    build.  

2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
    variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters. 

3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
    Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

4.  **You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers**.

5.  Avoid pull requests that add a large bundle of features or address a large range of issues. 
    Pull requests should only address one aspect/issue to keep reviews quick and accurate.
